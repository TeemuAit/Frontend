<p>The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.

    Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep.
    They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches.
    They have two toes, fused together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.
